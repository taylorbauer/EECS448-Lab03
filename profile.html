<h3 style="color:#ff6699">About me:</h3>
<p>I may not look like much, but rest assured, I am a very special cat with quite the backstory. My three littermates and I were found in a cardboard box inside a car at a junkyard when we were newborns.  My best buddy, Taylor (who is a phenomenal programmer, btw), used to work at the Lawrence Humane Society, and fostered us when we were only two weeks old.  He must have liked me most of all, because I got to stay at his house when my brothers and sister had to stay at the animal shelter.</p>
<p>Ever since, I've had a great life.  I've become FAT and PROUD OF IT.  I have a couple of roommates who happen to be dogs, and, while we don't get along great, it's always good to have a bustling household!</p>
<p>Here's some basic stats about me:<br><br>
    <b> Age:</b> 3.5 yrs<br>
    <b> Weight:</b> FAT<br>
    <b> Favorite activity:</b> tearing paint of the walls, meowing loudly at inappropriate times<br>
    <b> Favorite food:</b> chicken pat√© and kale (of all things)<br>
    <b> Sofas destroyed:</b> 1<br>
    <b> Houseplants killed:</b> 4<br>

Here's <a href="https://ocasio-cortez.house.gov/">the website of my favorite politician, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez</a>, who I believe is one of the many faces of this positive change!</li></ul></p>
